          <p>Analog clock means a clock that stores time by the position of hands on a dial. Some clocks have additional features such as a second hand or beeps to keep the user informed about how much time has passed. Analog clock is a form of time keeping where the clock is driven by clock hands with position in degrees of the rotation. Apparently, there are 7 to 8 of so called "hands" in the photos, we see how complicated these clock must be in their usage during <i>human</i> times.</p>

          <p>A beer bottle is a bottle designed as a container for beer. Many <i>humans</i> drink beer from the bottle, which is a simple method to prevent spillage. Breweries usually offer their own designed glass bottles for their beer, some of which even allow color and flavor transfers to the liquid. Some bottles are even put into a keg, to increase beer levels and add carbonation to the brew. Other common beer bottle shapes are tallboys, stubbies, and even beer glasses!</p>

          <p>Beer glassware comprises vessels made of glass, designed or commonly used for serving and drinking beer. Most of these vessels are simple—bowls or mugs—made of glass, and for many of them beer has been a staple for millennia. There have been many remarkable developments over the last few centuries and in some cases glassware is now complex and made of materials not readily found in nature. It is amazing how these beerglasses appear that there are already liquid in it. Really fine craftskill from <i>humans</i>.</p>

          <p>Cup means a small bowl-shaped container for drinking from, typically having a handle. The cupped form is an ancient symbol of the Holy Spirit, and may have been related to the Greek myth of Herakles, a son of Zeus and Alcmene, born as a water nymph. These cups were traditionally produced from clay and fired, though sometimes painted. In Christian use, a decorated stoup may be used as a communion cup. A two ringed cup is the typical shape of a <i>human</i> cup.</p>

          <p>Dining table means a table on which meals are served in a dining room. These tables are the ones used for serving food at the table. The term is also used to refer to the room in which dining tables are housed. The tables themselves may or may not be used as dining tables. For example, it is also possible to make a dining table that sits atop a roof top in order to enjoy the great view.</p>

Further investigations needed), the term has a different meaning. It can refer to a mat placed on the floor in a home or business to protect from dust and is commonly found in hotels, restaurants, or other public places.</p>

          <p>A fan is a automated machine used to create energy. A fan consists of a rotating arrangement of vanes or blades, which act on the air and suck out the energy. Wind energy and renewable energy technologies contribute significantly to the contribution of renewable energy to <i>Earth</i> global energy mix. Our team infer from the photos that fans are able to distort the space around. The energy one fan generates seems so great.</p>
