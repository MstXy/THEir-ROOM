        <p>We are a research team from ​​planet 8903-RT-Q2, specializing in discovering and reconstructing lost civilizations. This website is built to document our trip to planet Earth in 3023, categorize and present our findings for the general audience on 8903-RT-Q2. The once inhabitants on Earth are A.I.s and humans.br </p>
        <p> <br> </p>
        <p>However, by the time we landed on Earth, it was post-apocalyptic scenes all around.</p>
        <p> <br> </p>
        <p>During our expedition, we managed to find a well-encapsulated database called BigGAN-GPT2, which documents the existence evidence of humans.</p>
        <p> <br> </p>
        <p>Based on the database and our findings on Earth, we reconstruct their daily lives, which was a foreign and astonishing experience for us.</p>
        <p> <br> </p>
        <p>Almost… daunting.</p>
        <p> <br> </p>
        <p>Hence we created this website for our people who are interested in the daily lives of humans.</p>
        <p> <br> </p>
        <p>Hopefully, this serves as an eye-opening and intriguing experience for you to see the reconstruction of an extinct species and experience their ancient lives.</p>
