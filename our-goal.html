            <p>We are a research team from ​​planet 8903-RT-Q2, specializing in discovering and reconstructing lost civilizations. This website is built to document our trip to planet <i>Earth</i> in 3023, categorize and present our findings for the general audience on 8903-RT-Q2.</p>
            <p>The once inhabitants on <i>Earth</i> are <i>A.I.s</i> and <i>humans</i>. However, by the time we landed on <i>Earth</i>, it was post-apocalyptic scenes all around.</p>
            <p>During our expedition, we managed to find a well-encapsulated database called BigGAN-GPT2, which documents the existence evidence of humans. The database is so inclusive and informative yet well-preserved that our researchers spent 5 years on decypting and digging into every piece of data. It was a foreign and astonishing experience for us.</p>
            <p>Almost… daunting.</p>

            <p>But it's finally here, after 5 years of struggle.</p>
            <p>Based on the database and our findings on <i>Earth</i>, we reconstruct <i>human's</i> daily lives, and we proudly present this website to our people, breaking the myth and reveal the truth to whoever interested in the lives of <i>humans</i>.</p>
            <p>Hopefully, this serves as an eye-opening and intriguing experience for you to see the reconstruction of an extinct species and experience their ancient lives.</p>
